      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Emery Chikezie</strong>, and I have my educational
        background in Biochemistry
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a student at
        <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com/" target="_blank">Alt School Africa</a>, currently studying Software
        Engineering from one of the best
        tutors(<strong><em>Setemi Ojo</em></strong>) in the world. My Alt School ID number is
        <strong>ALT/SOE/023/2036</strong>

      <p>I love the Internet, technology and building beautiful things</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of my training at Alt School Africa, the major goal I have
        is to become a <strong>World-Class Software Engineer</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        I also hope to hone the following skills to help me achieve the goals
        I have set for embarking on this course:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>Technical Writing</li>
        <li>Communication skills</li>
        <li>Collaboration</li>
        <li>Design Thinking</li>
        <li>Process Engineering</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Alt School?</h2>

        to build and grow the career you want.
